In order to be able to connect MySQl and .NET you need:
- Running Mysql server
- Created database from the script file
- Plugins:
	 - MySql Connector for .NET (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/)
		- This is mandatory
	 - MySQL for Visual Studio (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/visualstudio/)
